This project is created to start practicing Webdriveio.

Steps
1) WDIO Setup & Installation
2) Install Webpack and React and run the App.js on React
3) Run clinic.count.e2e.ts test on https://localhost:3000 with command `wdio run wdio.conf.ts --spec ./test/specs/clinic.count.e2e.ts`

Problem

On the test log there appears to be an error of `Request failed with status 404 due to invalid session id: invalid session id`

As a result of this can't proceed with testing.
